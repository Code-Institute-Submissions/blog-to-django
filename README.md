Foodlovers all over the World like to share their tips and trix. As the fourth project of code-institute I made a blog based on frameworks.

The website is built in a MVT structure built in Django and Bootstrap to handle a clean and safe front-end design.

There are also a Django filter and a Django-CKEditor extension embedded in the blog.

These functions optimally handle python logic and keep the kiss (keep it simple s*****) code to its limit.

In short, all python logic, CSS style, and frontend logic is embedded and tested with the framework.

This is a blog website aimed at food.

## Future update
Even if the website is fast and works great with all the frameworks, there are still many improvements. 

If this were to be a serious blog, the design needs to be up to date, and a lot more interactive design.

Sass enables the website to break free from the default design of Bootstrap and keep the speed and flexibility of frameworks. 

Today's machines are fast enough to handle interactive design and Java Scripts is the leader in front-end interaction. 

Many things can be improved here. 


The **security** aspect is an important one and there is no function of reporting misbehavior or even hack attacks. 
Keep in mind that this website is made by a student in hast of learning to work fast with frameworks.

Happy coding!
